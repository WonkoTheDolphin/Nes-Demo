This sample NES demo is presented as part of my graduate research project
for CS 407: Seminar at Eastern Oregon University.
It demonstrates core features of the NES using 6502/2A03 assembly language,
such as how to render graphics and handle user input.

This code was initially forked from the GitHub repository "example.s",
